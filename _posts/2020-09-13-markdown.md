This is a test post.

According the definitoin of Markdown:

> Markdown is a markup language with a syntax closer to plain text. The idea of Markdown is to get out of the author's way so they can write their HTML content quickly, making Markdown very suitable as a blog authoring syntax.

`Markdown == Markup`? Is this a confusing definition?
